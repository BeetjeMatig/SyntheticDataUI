# SyntheticDataUI

SyntheticDataUI is a Django-based web application for generating synthetic data. It was developed as part of a Field Project for BSC Data Science & Society at the University of Groningen. 

The goal of the application is to provide a user-friendly interface for uploading CSV files, generating synthetic records using agent-based modelling, and downloading the results.

The project was developed for the Municipality of Leeuwarden. It is intended to be used by data scientists and analysts who need to create synthetic datasets for testing, training, or privacy-preserving purposes.

## Features
- Upload a CSV file and edit the data directly in the browser.
- Generate synthetic records using the algorithms defined in `synth_ui/frontend/synth.py`.
- Download the generated synthetic data or evaluation metrics.

## Setup

### Create the Conda environment
1. Install [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/) if you don't already have it.
2. Create the environment from `environment.yml`:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create an environment named **SYNTHETIC** with all required dependencies.
Activate it with:

```bash
conda activate SYNTHETIC
```

### Database migrations
Run the initial migrations to set up the SQLite database:

```bash
python synth_ui/manage.py makemigrations
```

Then apply the migrations:

```bash
python synth_ui/manage.py migrate
```

### Launch the development server
Start the Django development server:

```bash
python synth_ui/manage.py runserver
```

Then open your browser to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to upload a CSV and try generating synthetic records.
## Usage
1. Navigate to the web application in your browser.
2. Upload a CSV file containing the data you want to synthesize.
3. Edit the data directly in the browser if needed.
4. Click the "Generate Synthetic Data" button to create synthetic records.
5. Download the generated synthetic data or evaluation metrics as needed.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Work
Future enhancements may include:
- Support for additional data formats (e.g., Excel, JSON).
- More advanced synthetic data generation algorithms.
- A more generalized approach to handle different types of data and relationships.
- A user-interface that allows for more complex configurations and settings.
